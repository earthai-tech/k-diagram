  abstract = {PYTHON 3 Reference Manual (Python Documentation MANUAL Part 2). Python is an easy-to-learn object-oriented programming language, which combines power with clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high-level data types, and dynamic typing. Python is free software. It can be used with GNU (GNU/Linux), Unix, Microsoft Windows, and many other systems. This is a printed softcover copy of the official Python documentation from the latest Python 3.0 distribution. For each copy sold, $1 will be donated to the Python Software Foundation by the publisher. This book is part of a brand new six-part series of Python documentation books. Searching for "Python Documentation Manual" will show all six available books. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Guido van Rossum, is the inventor of Python. Fred L. Drake, Jr. is the official editor of the Python documentation.},
