Version 1.3.2
----------------

*(Released: 2025-10-31)*

This is a polish and feature-enhancement release focused on **flexible axis labeling**, 
**new rendering modes**, and **standardized figure saving**. It introduces an 
"annular" (curved) mode for feature interactions, a  new "cbueth" 
(reviewer-inspired) mode for error violins, and a unified `kdiagram.savefig` 
helper to streamline saving plots.

This release addresses several sources of label overlap in circular plots and 
strengthens the API for both polar and Cartesian plotting.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* |Feature| **Figure Saving** (``kdiagram.savefig``):
  A new, unified helper to save figures safely from either a ``Figure``,
  an ``Axes``, or the *current* active Matplotlib figure.

  - Creates parent folders as needed, expands ``~`` and env-vars, and
    generates unique filenames (e.g., ``plot (1).png``) when ``overwrite=False``.
  - Smart close control via ``close={"auto", True, False}``:
    ``"auto"`` closes only when the helper auto-fetched the
    current figure; explicit figures/axes are never closed unless
    requested.
  - Warns and returns ``None`` when no active figure exists and no
    ``fig_or_ax`` is provided.

* |Feature| **Curved Annular Mode for Feature Interaction**
  (``mode="annular"`` in :func:`~kdiagram.plot.feature_based.plot_feature_interaction`):
      
  Bins are rendered as **curved annular sectors** (wedge bars) for an
  elegant, non-rectangular polar heatmap. Ideal for presentations and
  publications.

  - New parameters: ``edgecolor``, ``linewidth`` to style annuli.
  - New **generic tick controls** for *both* θ and r:
    ``theta_ticks``, ``theta_ticklabels``, ``theta_tick_step``,
    ``r_ticks``, ``r_ticklabels``, ``r_tick_step`` (accept sequences,
    mappings, or callables for labels).

* |Feature| **Reviewer-Inspired Polar Error Violins**
  (``mode="cbueth"`` in :func:`~kdiagram.plot.errors.plot_error_violins`): A new
  mode, named in honor of a JOSS reviewer, that provides superior
  visual comparison.

  - For 1-2 models (``overlay="auto"``), it creates a compact overlay
    on a **single spoke** with transparency.
  - For 3+ models, it uses split-spokes with model names placed
    **outside the rim** to keep the plot interior clean.
  - New parameters: ``bw_method`` (KDE smoothing), ``overlay``
    (``True``/``False``/``"auto"``), ``overlay_angle``.
  - When ``show_stats=True``, median & skew are cleanly added to the
    **legend entry**, not on the plot itself.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* |Enhancement| **Smarter Outside-Rim Labeling:** Polar plots that
  use split spokes, like ``plot_error_violins(mode="cbueth")``
  and ``plot_model_drift``, now
  place labels just **outside the rim** with adaptive headroom and
  upright text, preventing label-data collisions.

* |Enhancement| **Axes-first API for Coverage Plots**:
  :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage` now fully
  honors an ``ax`` parameter (for all kinds, including ``"radar"``)
  and provides a ``dpi`` argument for consistent saving.

* |Enhancement| **Improved Error Violin Visuals:** The new
  ``mode="cbueth"`` uses a central dot for the zero-error reference
  (instead of a full circle) and has adaptive radial headroom to
  ensure outside labels don’t clip.

* |Enhancement| **Graceful Missing-Bin Handling:** Both ``basic`` and
  ``annular`` modes of :func:`~kdiagram.plot.feature_based.plot_feature_interaction`
  now reindex the aggregated data to the full (r × θ) grid,
  preventing visual errors or jitter when some bins are empty.

* |Enhancement| **Consistent Tick Mapping:** Polar tick placement now
  correctly respects the selected angular span (``acov``) and the
  ``theta_period`` or data min/max mapping, ensuring custom labels
  line up with the correct data points after scaling.

* |Enhancement| **Standardized Saving:** All plotting functions have
  been updated to call the new ``kdiagram.savefig`` helper
  internally, ensuring consistent save behavior, path handling, and
  figure closing logic across the entire library.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* |Fix| **Annular Edge Artifacts:** ``mode="annular"`` in ``plot_feature_interaction``
  now defaults to ``edgecolor="none"`` and ``linewidth=0``,
  eliminating black seams between wedges seen on some
  Matplotlib backends.
* |Fix| **Stray/Blank Figure Windows:** Centralized saving via
  ``kdiagram.savefig`` resolves issues where calling a plot
  function with a ``savefig`` path would sometimes show or save
  an extra empty figure.
* |Fix| **Polar Tick Label Order:** Fixed a bug where custom tick
  labels could appear in the wrong order after the ``theta``-to-span
  mapping was applied.
* |Fix| **Overlapping Labels:** Resolved several cases where in-plot
  statistics or tick labels (e.g., in `set_thetagrids`) would
  overlap with data or the plot frame in polar layouts.
* |Fix| **Windows Test Stability:** Time-index generation in tests
  was updated to avoid platform-specific overflows.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* |Docs| **New How-to Guide:** Added a "How-to: Saving Figures Reliably"
  guide covering ``kdiagram.savefig`` usage, the ``close="auto"``
  behavior, and path handling.
* |Docs| **Enriched Development Guide:** The ``development.rst`` guide
  has been significantly expanded with narrative descriptions and
  code-level citations for each architectural layer, API convention,
  and testing strategy, making it a comprehensive guide for new
  contributors.
* |Docs| **Gallery Updates for Error Violins:** Added **Use Case 3
  (Two-Model Overlay)** and **Use Case 4 (Three-Model Split-Spokes)**
  to the error-violins gallery, demonstrating the new
  ``mode="cbueth"`` with narrative, code, and interpretation.
* |Docs| **Gallery Updates for Feature Interaction:** The feature
  interaction guide now documents ``mode="annular"`` and the new
  *generic tick API*, including examples with domain-aware ticks
  (e.g., "Open 9:30").
* |Docs| **Polar Labeling Tips:** Added guidance for readable outside-rim
  labels and when to prefer ``fig.supylabel`` over axis-level labels
  with tight bounding boxes.

Testing & QA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* |Tests| Added a new test suite for :func:`kdiagram.savefig`,
  verifying its behavior with ``ax=None``, ``close="auto"``, and
  directory-only paths.
* |Tests| Added a new test suite for
  ``plot_feature_interaction(mode="annular")``, validating
  annular rendering and the new **generic tick controls**
  (sequence, mapping, and callable).
* |Tests| Added a new test suite for
  ``plot_error_violins(mode="cbueth")``, checking overlay
  behavior, outside label placement, and that stats correctly
  appear in the legend.

Backwards Compatibility Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Default Error-Violin Mode:** The default for
  :func:`~kdiagram.plot.errors.plot_error_violins` is now
  **`mode="cbueth"`**. To reproduce legacy
  visuals, you must explicitly set `mode="basic"`.
* **Figure Saving**. If you were previously calling the internal
  ``safe_savefig``, please switch to the public ``kdiagram.savefig``.
* **Annular Rendering is Opt-in:** The `basic` (rectangular) polar
  heatmap remains the default for
  :func:`~kdiagram.plot.feature_based.plot_feature_interaction`.
  You must set `mode="annular"` to use the new curved wedges.
